1. When smoothing the CPU temperature, do you think you got a better result with LOESS or Kalman smoothing? What differences did you notice?
Certainly using Kalman smoothing is better in this case as it considers a lot more factors for a better prediction noise and smoothing signals. Kalman is more sensitive when compared to LOESS smoothing as, again, it takes more factors to get a better smoothing.

2. In the GPX files, you might have also noticed other data about the observations: time stamp, course (heading in degrees from north, 0–360), speed (in m/s). How could those have been used to make a better prediction about the “next” latitude and longitude?
Using course could make a much better prediction of position. Time stamp can help with predicting based on difference between observations. Speed might help with predicting distance more precisely.
