1. Which of the four transforms suggested got you the closest to satisfying the assumptions of a T-test?

The weekly data transformation got the closest for assumptions for a T-test, showing better normality and a better equal-variance p-value.


2. We gave imprecise English translations of what the by-week test, and the Mann-Whitney test were actually testing. Do the same for the original T-test, and for the transformed data T-test. That is, describe what the conclusion would be if you could reject the null hypothesis in those tests.

For Original T-test if you could reject the null hypothesis, it would mean that the average number of Reddit posts differs significantly between weekdays and weekends. And for Transformed Data T-test Rejecting the null hypothesis here would mean that there is still a significant difference in the average number of posts between weekdays and weekends after transforming the data correctly for distribution or variance problems.


3. Of the four approaches, which do you think actually does a better job of getting an answer for the original question: “are there a different number of Reddit comments posted on weekdays than on weekends?” Briefly explain why. (It's not clear to me that there is a single correct answer to this question.)

The Mann-Whitney U-test might do a better job. Especially when normality and equal variance assumptions didnt meet fully, so it answers the question without assuming normal distributions, giving a strong compare between weekdays and weekends.


4. When are more Reddit comments posted in /r/canada, on average weekdays or weekends?

More Reddit comments are likely posted on weekdays than weekends in /r/canada when looking at the normality and variance test results, as was concluded from the statistical significance indicating a difference in posting between these periods.
