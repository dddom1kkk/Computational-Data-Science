1. In the hint above, what is the result of the calculation data['timestamp']*fit.slope + fit.intercept? What is the type, and describe the values.
The result is the prediction of rating for each timestamp. Its type is float64 and values as said earlier, prediction of rating for each timestamp.

2. In the same hint, why does this produce a fit line on the graph? Why are the created_at values and timestamp values paired correctly to make points on the plot?
This produces a fit line because linear regression function applies to timestamps and then plots them on the graph. The created_at values and timestamp values paired correctly because timestamp values derived from created_at values so when plotting against rating anf timestamp it creates accurate line on the graph.
